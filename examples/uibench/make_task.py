"""Generate a CORAL task config for one UI-Bench task in one arm.

    python make_task.py --id 2 --arm adaptive --model haiku --attempts 24
    python make_task.py --id 2 --arm yoked --schedule ../../sched/adaptive-2.json
    python make_task.py --id 2 --arm static

Writes ``configs/<name>/task.yaml`` (default name ``<task>_<arm>``). CORAL validates
a task *directory* and requires the config to be named ``task.yaml``, so each run
config gets its own directory.

Generated, never hand-written. The three arms must be identical in everything
an agent can see, and hand-maintaining near-copies is exactly how the previous
generation of these configs drifted until their task names announced their own
conditions. Here the arm touches only `grader.args.evolution`; the whole `task:`
block is a pure function of the UI-Bench row, so it is byte-identical across
arms by construction.

Prompts come from the pinned dataset revision. The task name carries the
UI-Bench title and nothing about the arm, and `grader.hide_args` keeps the
evolution config out of the file agents can read.

    - You have the `frontend-design` skill. Use it before writing any code.
    - After each eval, decide: refine or pivot. A pivot means a fundamentally
      different page, not a CSS rewrite.
    - Read the grading feedback for the criteria actually applied to your
      latest attempt before deciding what to change.
